  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (with Sanity settings)
  - [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) (with Sanity settings)
  - [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) + [.npmignore](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package)
  - Build scripts (pre-publish build + verify)
- Verifies plugin conventions before publishing:
  - No unused dependencies
  - No undeclared dependencies
  - Referenced files exist, has correct casing and is publishable
  - Has an [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) compatible license definition
  - Has a valid plugin config, if present
  - `react`/`react-dom` declared as peer dependencies, if used
  - ... and more ...
